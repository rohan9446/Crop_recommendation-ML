# Crop_recommendation-ML

This repository has a machine learning project I did that focuses on crop recommendation. The project aims to help farmers make informed decisions about suitable crops for cultivation based on various agricultural parameters such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, precipitation, pH and precipitation. The dataset used in this work consists of 2200 samples, including 22 unique crop species. I have used several classifiers including Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extra Trees to predict the most suitable crops for given input parameters The data set is partitioned into training and testing for model analysis. I used popular Python libraries like Pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, model training and visualization. Through extensive testing and model analysis, I found that the Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) classifier performed exceptionally well, achieving an impressive test accuracy of 99.39% and train accuracy of 99.54% .
